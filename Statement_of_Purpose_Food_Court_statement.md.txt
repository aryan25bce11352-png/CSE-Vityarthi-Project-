---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern food court environments, characterized by high customer traffic and diverse ordering needs, require an efficient system to manage customer data, streamline the ordering process, and provide actionable insights for business improvement. The current method often involves manual tracking or fragmented systems, leading to slow service, inaccurate data collection, and difficulty in analyzing popular trends and customer behavior. The core problem is the lack of a unified, automated, and data-driven platform for managing customer transactions and deriving key business intelligence.

## 2. Scope of the Project

The scope of the **Food Court Management System** is a console-based application focused on core operational and analytical functions within a single food court setting.

### In Scope:
* **Customer Profile Management:** Creation and storage of basic customer demographics (name, age, city, country).
* **Order Transaction Handling:** Recording item, quantity, and linking orders to specific customer profiles.
* **Billing:** Calculation of the total bill based on menu prices and quantities.
* **Basic Feedback:** Capturing a simple customer rating.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Generation of visual reports (bar charts, pie charts, histograms) for internal business intelligence, specifically focusing on orders, customer distribution, and bill amounts.

### Out of Scope:
* Integration with Point of Sale (POS) hardware or external payment gateways.
* Real-time inventory management.
* User authentication (beyond the initial 'user' or 'employee' selection).
* Advanced security or encryption features.
* A graphical user interface (GUI); the system remains console-based.
